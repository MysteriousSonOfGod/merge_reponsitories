## Shennong

After Nvwa repaired the sky, there was a child born in a cave. But something oddly happened: nine wells appeared naturally around the cave and the water in them was connected to each other. If one of them was touched, the other eight would also fluctuate.

The child was born with a natural appearence. His body is transparent in which the internal organs are clearly visible. He has the bull's head with two horns. People believed this was God's deity and it was him who brought those nine wells.

When he grew up, everyone elected him as the tribal leader and call him Yan Emperor. He gained seeds of food and taught people to loose soil and dig wells to irrigate seedings. In the autumn of that year, a large number of seedings matured, people all praised his merits.

All the preparations for the people's life were completed. With outstanding achievements, he was respected as Shennong and thought as the god of Chinese agriculture.
