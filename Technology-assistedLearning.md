如今科技的发展已经越来越显著地影响着我们的生活和学习方式。对于语言的学习也不例外。

现在我们拥有各式各样的学习语言软件，允许我们免于携带厚重的书本，只需收集就能联系外语。丰富的在线学习资源能够极大的节约成本。甚至有许多网络平台，允许我们和外国人在屏幕上面对面交流。更重要的是，在电影、网页上学习外语，更能潜移默化培养外语能力，提升学习兴趣。借助科技确实方便了语言学习，但是也许还是有些潜在的问题。

科技带来的最大问题是阅读碎片化。而对于语言的学习需要专注和思考，因此有时效率不高。另外，好记性不如烂笔头，语言学习尤其需要动手书写，这样才能加强学习效果。而且，大多数人的自制力不强，容易被其他信息吸引，分散注意力，而舍弃了语言的学习。

因此，在我看来，technology-assisted是应该推荐的，但是语言学习绝不能脱离纸笔和勤奋的练习。充分利用科技的便利，培养兴趣，才能进步。

Nowadays, the development of science and technology has increasely influenced our way of life and learning. Language learning is no excepetion.

Now that we have a variety of applications to help learn a language, which allow us to study everywhere with a mobile phone and be free from carrying heavy books. Rich online learning resources can greatly save the costs. There are even many web platforms allow us to communicate with foreigners face-to-face across the screen. More importantly, seeing foreign movies and scanning foreign web pages can subtly cultivate skills and enhance interests.

Technology does facilitate language learning, but there may still be some potential problem.

The biggest problem with technology is reading fragmentation. Learning language requires concentration and deep thinking. In addition, good memory is worse than bad writing, it needs hands-on writing particular, so as to enhance learning effect. Moreover, people's self-control is not strong, they're easy to distract attention.

In my opinion, Technology-assisted Learning should be recommended, but learning must not be separated from writing and recording. Make full use of it and make progress easily.
