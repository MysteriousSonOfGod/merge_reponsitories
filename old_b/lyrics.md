## 1965

Can we go back to the world we had? With the love so sweet it makes me so sad.

Can we go back to the world we had? It's the world we've been dreaming of.

Can we go back to the world we had? Cut like diamonds we were made to the last.

## U can B what U wanna B

But that doesn't matter.

## Hypnotic

You did to me so well. Hypnotic taking over me.

I don't wanna come back down. I don't wanna touch the ground.

## Walk Away

A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade.

You better run away, run away, run away.
