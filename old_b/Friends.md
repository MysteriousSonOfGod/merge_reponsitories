# Friends

This is my second time watching _ Friends _. It's hard to describ my feeling now. 

Because I decide to learn English unmeantly, I choose to watch sitcom or something. I remember Friends which I saw last year. It is a genuine classic. But unfortunately, all the copyright has expired. I spend plenty of time to find it on netdisk, I promise that I will keep it forever. Why? There is no "why", it ust sends me a special feeling.

Last year I saw this sitcom, just for fun. But now, I have grew up and matured. It is Friends, it is the friends, that get me hypnotised. It is the perfect life attitude. I think of it there was a program named Conan Show, which once invited some protagonists of Friends (why no Ross and Chandler?). I was touched after watching it. Friends is a sitcom that was shooting at nearly twenty years ago. Everyone was getting old. Rachel is such a charming girl in Friends although a little bit capricious, but you can see she is an outstanding actor in reality. But the traces of time cannot be erased.

OK, I'm so tired now, I would fall asleep. Life is so fragrant, so I have to sleep and welcome the new day.
