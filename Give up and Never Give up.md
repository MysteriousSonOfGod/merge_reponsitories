1. “永不言弃”一直被认为是一种积极的生活态度，是个人成功的关键因素

2. 但是，也有人认为适当的放弃才是明智的选择

  　　3. 你对此的看法及理由



“永不言弃”一直被认为是一种积极的生活态度，是个人成功的关键因素。但是，也有人认为适当的放弃才是明智的选择。在我看来，明智的放弃和坚持不懈同样重要。当你确定一个明确的目标之后，才需要坚持不懈的朝着既定方向努力。

首先，一个明确的目标很重要。作为即将步入社会的大学生，生活中有太多的选择，我们往往纠结于如何选择一个最适合自己的方向。我们都有好奇心，什么都想尝试，什么都想做好，但事实上这样“贪多嚼不烂”，造成什么都会一点，但是没有什么深入了解的领域。如果仅仅浅尝辄止不能提升自己的核心竞争力。因此我们可以多多尝试新事物，及时放弃我们不需要的事物，选择自己真正热爱的事物。

当目标确定后，永不言弃就显得尤为重要了。量变的积累能够促成质变，在不断努力中你会积累经验，成为这一方面的大师。社会去要全才，但是应该在某一方面取得了卓越成就后再扩展知识面，这样才是提升自己能力的正确途径。坚持不一定会成功，但是放弃一定不会成功。

所以，明智地放弃不需要的，一旦选择就永不言弃。



Choose a Definit Target and Never Give up

"Never give up" is always a symbol of positive life attitude. To be honest, it's the necessary factor in personal success. However, some people think abandonment is the wise choice sometimes.

In my oppion, sensible renunciation is as important as perseverance. When you have a clear goal, you need to work tirelessly toward the established direction.

First of all, a clear goal is very important. As an undergraduate is about to enter the community, there are too many choices in life. We often struggle with choosing the direction that best suits you. We all have curiosity. We want to try everything and want to do well. However, in fact, too many directions cause you puzzled and there no deep understanding of any field. If you just try to avoid it, you can't improve your core competitiveness.

When the goal is set, it is particularly important to never give up. Accumulation of quantitative changes can contribure to qualitative change, and in continous efforts you will accumulate experience and become master in this area. So that it is the right way to improve one's ability. Perseverance will not necessarily succeed, but giving up will not succeed.
