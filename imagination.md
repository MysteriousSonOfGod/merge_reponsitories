I have made the determination that I have to learn English well. It's never late as long as it starts.

I analyzed the previous learning experience. I summarize some of my own tips. 

Firstly, I'm confident encough because of my successful experence. 
So I firmly believe that I can finish anything I wanner do. 
When I was in senior high school, I had done several special things which could be regard as my legendary story. 
I practice playing piano, because I love that. Why? To be honest, I don't know. 
I just wanner play it and I was looking forward to going home to play some simple music everyday. 
Just for fun, for myself, for my love of music. 
I don't care my grades. It's a complex state of mind. 
Not only that, I also start practice my handwriting skill. 
Now look back at the way I went through, I have to sign. 
After all I consider myself a winner. 

I learned from what I experienced that if you want to do something well, you must cultivate interest first. 
So I spent a few days to me fall in love with English perpetually. 
It occurres me that the peak level of my English should appear in high school, Grad 2. 
At that time I had a crush on a girl in my class, but it seemed she didn't care me. 
OK, after all, I'm so casual about everything, regardless of the past or the present. 
But, it's... Something was always hard to explain, unnecessary either. 
What counts is, I started to read English novels. 
Don't ask me why, many choice in my life, I just followed my mind. 
The first novel I read named _The piano_. It was easy and not prolix. 
Then I fell in love with reading origin works. 
The real fiction I read named _First Love_, whose author was a Former Soviet Union writer. 
It describes a complited love story, just as complicted as the real life. 
After that I read _The Sarrows of Young Whiter_, but I didn't finish it.
I forget why. 

OK, I'm tired, I wanner sleep and review lessons, now. 
it's unquestionable that only I pass all the examinations can I learn everything I love. 
There is no denying that I'm delayed by the damn school. 
Don't try to tie me down with those fucking examinations. 
There is no tricks to learn. Stop dreaming and to fight.
It is the persistence that should be the sharpest weapon.
