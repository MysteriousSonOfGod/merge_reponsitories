当今中国越来越受世界瞩目，中国的故事也被世界所关注，因此用英语讲好中国的故事就显得格外重要。在我看来，向外国人用英语介绍中国故事有以下几个要点。

中国作为四大文明古国之一，有着上下五千年的悠久历史， 首先当然是需要有深厚的中华文化底蕴，对中国传统故事，包括神话传说有一定的理解和感受，这才是正确表达故事内容的基础。第二应该善于用英语表达故事内容。这里需要分析中国故事中一些特有的词汇在英文中如何翻译，思考如何在在基本内容表达清楚的基础上同时体现出故事所表达的思想。第三应该提高英语口语水平。如果能够有清晰的思路和流畅的表达，中国的故事对于外国人必然是很具有吸引力的。

最后但很重要的是，应该了解文化差异，讲故事同时展现中华文化的特色和传统，使中华文化更加国际化。

在我看来，用英语讲述中国故事是一项具有挑战性的任务，但是只要我们认真学好英语，相信我们可以用英语来解释好，讲清楚中国的故事！ 

Nowadays, China is getting more and more attention from the world, and the Chinese story is also concerned by the world. Therefore, it is very important to tell Chinese stories well in English. In my opinion, there are some points to introduce foreigners to English stories in English.

As one of the four ancient civilizations, China has a long history of 5,000 years.First of all, it is necessary to have a profound Chinese cultural heritage and have a certain understanding and thinking of Chinese traditional stories, especially myths and legends. This is the basis for the correct expression of the story content.

Second, we should be good at expressing stories in English. Here we need a good level of speaking and need to analyze how some of the unique Chinese vocabulary words are translated in English and think about how to express the ideas expressed in the story on the basis of clear expression.

Last but not least, it is important to understand cultural differences. Presenting the characteristics and traditions of Chinese culture can make Chinese culture more international.

Telling Chinese stories in English is a challenging task, but as long as we learn English well, I believe we can explain the story of China!
